        <h1>Privacy Policy for Bias Detector</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 23, 2025</p>
        
        <p>Welcome to Bias Detector. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Chrome Extension ("Service").</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Our Service is designed with your privacy as a priority. We collect the minimum amount of information necessary to provide and improve our service.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web Page Content:</strong> When you activate the extension on a web page, the extension's script reads the full text content of that page. This process happens locally within your browser. The content is then sent to our secure servers for the sole purpose of AI analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>User Account Information:</strong> To create an account, we collect your email address and a hashed password. If you sign up using Google, we receive your email address from your Google account.</li>
            <li><strong>Anonymous Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous, aggregated data about how you interact with the Service (e.g., number of analyses performed, types of biases detected). This data is not linked to your personal identity and is used to improve our AI models and user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information we collect is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide the Service:</strong> The scraped web page content is sent to our AI model to analyze for potential bias. The results are then returned to you. The content is not stored long-term and is deleted from our servers immediately after the analysis is complete.</li>
            <li><strong>To Maintain Your Account:</strong> Your email address is used to manage your account, provide customer support, and communicate important updates about the Service.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve Our Service:</strong> Anonymous usage data helps us understand how our extension is being used, allowing us to improve the accuracy of our AI and the overall functionality of the product.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not share the content of the web pages you analyze with any third parties.</li>
            <li>We may share anonymous, aggregated usage data with partners or for research purposes, but this data cannot be used to identify you.</li>
            <li>We will only disclose personal information if required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your information. All data transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted using modern cryptography (HTTPS/TLS). The web page content sent for analysis is processed in a secure environment and is not permanently stored.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>You have the right to access, update, or delete your account information at any time. You can uninstall the extension at any time to stop all data collection.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
